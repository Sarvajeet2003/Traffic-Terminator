![Namma Yatri Logo](/Users/sarvajeethuk/Desktop/Synthetic/image.png)

## Overview

This project presents an AI-driven solution for optimizing supply-demand balance during peak hours for Namma Yatri. The solution addresses one of the biggest challenges in urban mobility: the imbalance between supply and demand during peak hours, where riders struggle to find autos when they need them most, while drivers may reject trips due to traffic, distance, or fare concerns.

## Key Metrics

- **23%** Peak Hour Ride Denials
- **18 min** Average Wait Time (Peak)
- **â‚¹950** Average Daily Driver Earnings
- **72%** Average Acceptance Rate

## Solution Components

### Core AI Systems

1. **Hotspot Prediction**
   - Uses LSTM Neural Networks 
   - Predicts high-demand areas by time of day
   - Trained on 6 months of historical ride data
   - Forecasts demand for the next 24 hours in 1-hour intervals

2. **Dynamic Pricing**
   - Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning model
   - Optimizes pricing to balance supply and demand
   - State space includes demand level, supply level, time of day, day type, weather
   - 11 discrete price multipliers ranging from 1.0x to 2.0x

3. **Ride Matching**
   - Intelligent route optimization algorithm
   - Allows multiple passengers to share a single vehicle
   - Reduces costs for riders and increases earnings for drivers

4. **Queue Management**
   - Priority-based allocation system
   - Fair ride distribution during peak hours
   - Reduces wait times and ride denials

### User Experience Features

2. **Loyalty Queue System**
   - Priority based on ride history
   - Ride history rewards for frequent users
   - Referral benefits for user acquisition
   - Peak hour passes earned through off-peak usage

3. **WhatsApp Integration**
   - Direct queue access through WhatsApp
   - Real-time ride status notifications
   - Voice message support for booking
   - Wider accessibility for users with limited data

### Driver Engagement

1. **Experience-Based Incentives**
   - Rewards for app tenure and usage
   - Performance tiers with elite status
   - Training rewards for skill development
   - Mentorship program for experienced drivers

2. **Real-time Recommendations**
   - Location guidance by time of day
   - Personalized suggestions based on driver preferences
   - Reduces idle time and deadheading

## Expected Outcomes

### For Drivers
- 15-20% increase in daily earnings
